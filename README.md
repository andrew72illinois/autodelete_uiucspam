I have to delete UIUC End User Digest emails because they take up space and always say I have zero new messages
Update: Apparently I can't give admin access to the API calls that I specifically need using my illinois.edu account so instead of End Use Digest,
I'm deleting all advertisement mail I get on my personal account
